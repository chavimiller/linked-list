# linked-list

This project is a Linked List implementation built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript to deepen understanding of how data structures manage and link data dynamically. 
It includes a LinkedList class that supports core operations such as appending, prepending, inserting at specific indexes, searching for values, checking containment, and removing elements. 
Each list node is represented by a ListNode class that stores a value and a reference to the next node.
